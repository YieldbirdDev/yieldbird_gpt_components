# Changelog

This file contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of the project.
The main objective of keeping log of changes is to make it easier for developers to see precisely what changes have been made between each release of the project without going through noisy git logs.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

In addition to above spec use `Action` group to gather all needed actions required when new changes are deployed (for example new environment variable is required, rake task has to be run or new library needs to be installed). Keep in mind that there is single changelog for all services so be specific.
